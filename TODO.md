Create a personal portfolio webpage that lists the 3 projects as cards. 
These cards must have a screenshot of the project and a link to the GitHub repo for that project. 
It is fine if the repo is private on the Noroff account at this point in time.
This must be done on a public repo on your personal GitHub account.
You are free to use whatever tech stack youâ€™d like. The page must look good and be responsive.
Consider using GitHub pages to host it, otherwise, you can use Netlify.

This page must:

-   List the 3 projects as cards
-   Each card must have:
    -   the title of the project, (done)
    -   a description,
    -   a screenshot of how the project looks when running,
